# js-playground
“A collection of my JavaScript practice projects, experiments, and learning journey.”
# 🕹️ JS Playground  

Welcome to my **JavaScript dump yard** 🚀  
This is where I throw all the stuff I practice — from baby snippets 👶 to random experiments 🧪 to mini chaos projects 💥  

If it runs → it lives here.  
If it breaks → it *still* lives here 😎  

## 📌 What’s inside?
- 🔄 Loops (because going in circles is life)  
- 📦 Arrays & Objects (hoarding data like a pro)  
- 🧠 Functions (brain cells of code)  
- 🎮 Mini projects (quiz apps, calculators, random chaos, many more)  
- ✨ New JS concepts I discover on the way  

---
🎯 Why tho?

Because coding is like going to the gym 💪 — reps matter.
This repo = my training ground, my sandbox, my chaos lab.

Made with ☕, late nights 🌙, and too many console.log()s.
